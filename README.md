This project presents a machine-learning–based framework for optimizing Laser Powder Bed Fusion (LPBF) process parameters for the Ti-6Al-4V alloy. Ti-6Al-4V is widely used in aerospace and biomedical applications due to its high strength-to-weight ratio and corrosion resistance, yet its mechanical properties are highly sensitive to LPBF processing conditions. The goal of this work is to develop a data-driven approach that can predict key mechanical properties and recommend new process parameter sets for experimental validation.

The controllable LPBF process parameters considered in this study include laser power, scan speed, hatch spacing, and layer thickness. These parameters are treated as input features to a surrogate machine-learning model. The output targets are yield strength (YS) and elastic modulus (E). Because improving yield strength typically reduces elastic modulus (and vice versa), the model is designed to optimize one objective at a time rather than combining them into a single scalar objective.

The algorithm implemented is a surrogate model based optimization workflow around a neural network trained with the Adam optimization algorithm. A feed forward neural network is defined using PyTorch and trained via a standard training loop consisting of a forward pass, loss computation, backpropagation, and parameter update (loss.backward() followed by optimizer.step()), where Adam is chosen for its adaptive learning rate and stable convergence on nonlinear, noisy LPBF data. 

The optimization generates new parameter recommendations by exploring the feasible parameter space while remaining within reasonable bounds of the training data. After training, the model will provide three parameter sets. The recommended process parameters are automatically written to the output file (To be tested.xlsx). And users can physically run the experiment and manually record results back to the main datasheet (lpbf_ti64_data.xslx) for iterative training. To reflect the known tradeoff between YS and E, the workflow produces multiple recommendations per run, including parameter sets that favor higher yield strength and others that favor higher elastic modulus. Randomized sampling is incorporated so that repeated executions of the optimization will generate varied recommendations.

At its current stage, this project demonstrates proof of concept functionality rather than a finalized optimization solution. Prediction reliability is limited by dataset size, and experimental validation is required to assess the physical accuracy of the recommendations. Future work will focus on expanding the dataset, introducing uncertainty quantification, and extending the framework to multi-objective optimization approaches such as Pareto-front analysis.
